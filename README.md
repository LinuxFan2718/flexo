## how to use

make flexo executable

```
chmod +x flexo
```

start engine by running flexo to send UCI commands on the terminal

```
./flexo
```
or use a UCI program like `scid`. If using scid, make sure to set the "directory" as the directory that flexo is checked out in. To make the log file write, exit scid.
